Sept 14, 2017:&nbsp; The party is still in the "founding" state.&nbsp; This 
party needs to have more definition of exactly what the party should be and how 
it should function.&nbsp; This needs to be decided by the public, not by one 
individual.&nbsp; I have posted several documents in the "about" link to help us 
to get started. We need to further define this.&nbsp; We need party founders, 
that is you!&nbsp; Please join the party to help us move forward.&nbsp; Please 
send email to <a href="mailto:naippus@gmail.com">naippus@gmail.com</a> now as we 
need more work on our webpage for this. </p>
