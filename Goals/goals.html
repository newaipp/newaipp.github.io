<span class="auto-style12"> The goal of this party is to create a third party that is democratically run
within the party.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">Create a party
that is not corrupt as current system is.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Allow for real people, not just professional overpaid politicians.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Bring back common sense to our political system.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Have politicians of characters in our offices.
</span>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style12">Allow for real people to be able to
support the political system and be involved in our politics.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Create a political party that can changes as society changes, unlike our
current parties.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style11" style="width: 1384px; height: 295px; position: absolute; left: 69px; top: 354px">
<span class="auto-style12">The problem with our other major parties is that there are no checks and
balances within the parties themselves.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">The parties (mainly the Republican and Democrat party) are run by a few
elite people.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">You can view this by
looking at the leadership of the parties listed in their party platforms.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">This has lead to corruption within these parties.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">This has created a system in which only the few elite friends and select
members by the elite of the party are allowed to run for office.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Our party eliminates this by having voted in leadership of the party and
checks and balances within the system, much as our federal government is
organized.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">All people are invited to
be involved with the party and can have their voices heard.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">How many times have you been able to state your opinions to the
leadership of our current parties and even had your voice even listened to.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Send them an email, it get thrown in the trash and you just get back a
condescending message pretending that they looked at your message. </span> </p>
<p class="auto-style10" style="width: 1389px; height: 69px; position: absolute; left: 66px; top: 279px">
<span class="auto-style12">Our current two parties are really just funding methods to get politicians into
office.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">If you are funded by them,
you be partisan and support those who funded them.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">After all you want to get</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">re-elected!</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10" style="width: 1376px; height: 167px; position: absolute; left: 73px; top: 638px">
<span class="auto-style12">Our forefathers envisioned that our political leadership would come from the
people, serve their term in office and then return back to their lives.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Most of our current politicians spend their lives grooming for office.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">As a result, they cannot afford to ever lose an election, otherwise their
career is over.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">They had no previous
work experiences, so cannot afford to lose their positions.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">They will do anything keep their positions!</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Our party is focused on having regular people serve in office and after
their terms are over, returning back to their previous lives.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="auto-style13" style="width: 1370px; height: 144px; position: absolute; left: 76px; top: 820px">
<span class="auto-style12">Our politicians have come to believe that they must have some greater ability to
represent us then regular Americans have.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">In fact, they have convinced many that this is the case.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">This is completely untrue that they are more qualified.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">They are actually less qualified to represent us.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">Our current politicians have been so far removed from the general
population and are now completely out of touch with how their policies will
affect us.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="auto-style10" style="width: 1364px; height: 76px; position: absolute; left: 79px; top: 964px">
<span class="auto-style12">In short, there are many, many reasons why our politicians are failing us.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">The root of this is caused by our current political parties have created
a few rich politicians and elite, but no longer represent the people in our
society.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10" style="width: 1364px; height: 234px; position: absolute; left: 80px; top: 1040px">
<span class="auto-style12">To solve this, we need regular people running for office and having a path and a
chance to win elections based upon their merits.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">The American people are very smart and capable, and I have complete faith
in the people of our country, but not our elite politicians.
</span>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style12">Our two parties believe that they can buy
are votes, but fail to realized that to win an election, you just need to get
more people to put a check in the box next to your name than who you are running
against.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">It is not all about money,
but it is really about convincing people to vote for you based upon your
character and position.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">A third
party candidate, especially with our current political situation, stands a
strong chance of winning an election.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="auto-style11" style="width: 1360px; height: 103px; position: absolute; left: 82px; top: 1275px">
<span class="auto-style12">The party needs to stay moderate and be organized so that it will stay moderate.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">To do this, a democratic party with many people involved, will always
stay moderate.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">There will be some
people on each extreme, but with enough people, the average will be forced to be
moderate.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style10" style="width: 1355px; height: 144px; position: absolute; left: 84px; top: 1382px">
<span class="auto-style12">I am trying to get this party geared up, but really I am not qualified to do
what is needed.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style12">But, there are many
people who are much more qualified than me and much more capable.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">I also think that with all of the power of the people, we cannot be beat,
and we have a chance to take our political system back!</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">We need volunteers because this will become a big job.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes" class="auto-style12">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style12">I am hoping that we can organize so that many hands can make light work.</span></p>
