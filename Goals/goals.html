The goal of this party is to create a third party that is democratically run 
within the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Create a party 
that is not corrupt as current system is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Allow for real people, not just professional overpaid politicians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bring back common sense to our political system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Have politicians of characters in our offices.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Allow for real people to be able to 
support the political system and be involved in our politics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Create a political party that can changes as society changes, unlike our 
current parties.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 132px; position: absolute; left: 9px; top: 191px">
The problem with our other major parties is that there are no checks and 
balances within the parties themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The parties (mainly the Republican and Democrat party) are run by a few 
elite people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You can view this by 
looking at the leadership of the parties listed in their party platforms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This has lead to corruption within these parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This has created a system in which only the few elite friends and select 
members by the elite of the party are allowed to run for office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our party eliminates this by having voted in leadership of the party and 
checks and balances within the system, much as our federal government is 
organized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All people are invited to 
be involved with the party and can have their voices heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>How many times have you been able to state your opinions to the 
leadership of our current parties and even had your voice even listened to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Send them an email, it get thrown in the trash and you just get back a 
condescending message pretending that they looked at your message. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 44px; position: absolute; left: 10px; top: 338px">
Our current two parties are really just funding methods to get politicians into 
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are funded by them, 
you be partisan and support those who funded them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After all you want to get<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
re-elected!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 66px; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 403px">
Our forefathers envisioned that our political leadership would come from the 
people, serve their term in office and then return back to their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most of our current politicians spend their lives grooming for office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, they cannot afford to ever lose an election, otherwise their 
career is over.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had no previous 
work experiences, so cannot afford to lose their positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They will do anything keep their positions!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our party is focused on having regular people serve in office and after 
their terms are over, returning back to their previous lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 66px; position: absolute; left: 7px; top: 490px">
Our politicians have come to believe that they must have some greater ability to 
represent us then regular Americans have.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, they have convinced many that this is the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is completely untrue that they are more qualified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are actually less qualified to represent us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our current politicians have been so far removed from the general 
population and are now completely out of touch with how their policies will 
affect us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 44px; position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 578px">
In short, there are many, many reasons why our politicians are failing us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The root of this is caused by our current political parties have created 
a few rich politicians and elite, but no longer represent the people in our 
society.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 88px; position: absolute; left: 11px; top: 640px">
To solve this, we need regular people running for office and having a path and a 
chance to win elections based upon their merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The American people are very smart and capable, and I have complete faith 
in the people of our country, but not our elite politicians.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Our two parties believe that they can buy 
are votes, but fail to realized that to win an election, you just need to get 
more people to put a check in the box next to your name than who you are running 
against.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not all about money, 
but it is really about convincing people to vote for you based upon your 
character and position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A third 
party candidate, especially with our current political situation, stands a 
strong chance of winning an election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 44px; position: absolute; left: 15px; top: 745px">
The party needs to stay moderate and be organized so that it will stay moderate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To do this, a democratic party with many people involved, will always 
stay moderate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be some 
people on each extreme, but with enough people, the average will be forced to be 
moderate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 1557px; height: 66px; position: absolute; left: 14px; top: 808px">
I am trying to get this party geared up, but really I am not qualified to do 
what is needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, there are many 
people who are much more qualified than me and much more capable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I also think that with all of the power of the people, we cannot be beat, 
and we have a chance to take our political system back!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We need volunteers because this will become a big job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am hoping that we can organize so that many hands can make light work.</p>
